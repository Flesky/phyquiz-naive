# Newton's Laws of Motion

## First Law (Law of Inertia)
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an external force. 
> Formula: F = 0 (when there is no net external force)

## Second Law (Law of Acceleration)
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass.
> Formula: F = m*a (Force equals mass times acceleration)
   a = Fnet/m

## Third Law (Action-Reaction Law):
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
> Formula: F action = -F reaction

### Types of Force
#### Applied Force

Force applied to an object by a person or another object.

#### Gravitational Force

Force of attraction between two masses due to gravity.

#### Frictional Force

Force resisting the motion or tendency of motion between two surfaces.

# Kinematics

## Distance
A scalar quantity that refers to "how much ground an object has covered" during its motion is often computed using the following formula
> Formula: d = d1 + d2 + d3 + ... + dn

## Displacement
A vector quantity that refers to "how far out of place an object is"; it is the object's overall change in position.
> Formula: delta x = c^2 = a^2 + b^2

## Average Speed
The distance traveled divided by the time of travel.

## Average Velocity
The displacement or change in position divided by the time of travel.
![img_1.png](/images/formulas/kinematics/img_1.png)

## Average Acceleration
The change in velocity divided by the time of travel.

## Slope
The slope equation says that the slope of a line is found by determining the amount of rise of the line between any two points divided by the amount of run of the line between the same two points. In other words,
* Pick two points on the line and determine their coordinates
* Determine the difference in y-coordinates of these two points (rise). 
* Determine the difference in x-coordinates for these two points (run).
* Divide the difference in y-coordinates by the difference in x-coordinates (rise/run or slope).

The formula can be calculated using the slope equation:

## Shapes
The method used to find the area under a line on a velocity-time graph depends upon whether the section bound by the line and the axes is a rectangle, a triangle or a trapezoid. Area formulas for each shape are given below.

### Rectangle
> Area = b • h

### Triangle
> Area = 1/2 • b • h

### Trapezoid
> Area = 1/2 • (b1 + b2) • h

## Acceleration
That acceleration is the rate at which an object changes its velocity. It is the ratio of velocity change to time between any two points in an object's path. To accelerate at 9.8 m/s/s means to change the velocity by 9.8 m/s each second.

## Velocity of a Free Falling Object
The velocity of a free-falling object that has been dropped from a position of rest is dependent upon the time that it has fallen. The formula for determining the velocity of a falling object after a time of t seconds is given by formula.
> Formula: v = g • t

Where
* g is the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s/s on Earth)
* v: velocity of a free-falling object 
* t: seconds
