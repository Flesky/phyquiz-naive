    "description": "Kinematics aims to provide a description of the spatial position of bodies or systems of material particles, the rate at which the particles are moving (velocity), and the rate at which their velocity is changing (acceleration). When the causative forces are disregarded, motion descriptions are possible only for particles having constrained motionâ€”i.e., moving on determinate paths. In unconstrained, or free, motion, the forces determine the shape of the path.",
