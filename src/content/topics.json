    "description": "Kinematics aims to provide a description of the spatial position of bodies or systems of material particles, the rate at which the particles are moving (velocity), and the rate at which their velocity is changing (acceleration). When the causative forces are disregarded, motion descriptions are possible only for particles having constrained motionâ€”i.e., moving on determinate paths. In unconstrained, or free, motion, the forces determine the shape of the path.",

    "name": "Newton's Laws of Motion",
    "description": "Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. These three laws have been expressed in several ways, over nearly three centuries, and can be summarised as follows.",
