## Introduction

Like the study of all of physics, our study of 1-dimensional kinematics will be concerned with the multiple means by which the motion of objects can be represented. Such means include the use of words, the use of graphs, the use of numbers, the use of equations, and the use of diagrams. Lesson 2 focuses on the use of diagrams to describe motion. The two most commonly used types of diagrams used to describe the motion of objects are:

## [Ticker Tape Diagrams](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L2b.cfm)

-a device could track the location of a object moving in 1-dimension by placing a dot on a strip of paper. The trail of dots would represent the motion of the object as it changes its position over the course of time.

Before the advent of  computers in Physics labs, a common way of analyzing the motion of objects in physics labs was to perform a  **ticker tape analysis**. A long _tape_ was attached to a moving object and threaded through a device that placed a tick upon the tape at regular intervals of time - say every 0.10 second. As the object moved, it dragged the tape through the "ticker," thus leaving a trail of dots. The trail of dots provided a history of the object's motion and therefore a representation of the object's motion.

## **Dot Diagrams**

While the use of ticker tape analyses in Physics labs has mostly been replaced by the use of computer-interfaced motion detectors, the use of ticker tapes or _motion diagrams_ still persists in our Physics curriculum due to the visual nature of representing an object's motion. Such diagrams are referred to as dot diagrams, motion diagrams, oil drop diagrams, and (still) ticker tape diagrams.

The distance between dots on a dot diagram represents the object's position change during that time interval. A large distance between dots indicates that the object was moving fast during that time interval. A small distance between dots means the object was moving slow during that time interval. Dot diagrams for a fast- and slow-moving object are depicted below.

The analysis of a dot diagram will also reveal if the object is moving with a constant velocity or accelerating. A changing distance between dots indicates a changing velocity and thus an [acceleration](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm). A constant distance between dots represents a constant velocity and therefore no acceleration. Dot diagrams for objects moving with a constant velocity and with an accelerated motion are shown below.

And so dot diagrams provide one more means of representing various features of the motion of objects.

## [Vector Diagrams](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L2c.cfm)

-are diagrams that depict the direction and relative magnitude of a vector quantity by a vector arrow. Vector diagrams can be used to describe the velocity of a moving object during its motion.

For example, a vector diagram could be used to represent the motion of a car moving down the road.

In a vector diagram, the magnitude of a vector quantity is represented by the size of the vector arrow. If the size of the arrow in each consecutive frame of the vector diagram is the same, then the magnitude of that vector is constant. The diagrams below depict the velocity of a car during its motion. In the top diagram, the size of the velocity vector is constant, so the diagram is depicting a motion of constant velocity. In the bottom diagram, the size of the velocity vector is increasing, so the diagram is depicting a motion with increasing velocity - i.e., [an acceleration](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Class/1DKin/U1L1e.cfm).
