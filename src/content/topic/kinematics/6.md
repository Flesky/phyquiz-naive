### **The BIG 4**

The kinematic equations are a set of four equations that can be utilized to predict unknown information about an object's motion if other information is known. The equations can be utilized for any motion that can be described as being either a constant velocity motion (an acceleration of 0 m/s/s) or a constant acceleration motion. They can never be used over any time period during which the acceleration is changing. Each of the kinematic equations include four variables. If the values of three of the four variables are known, then the value of the fourth variable can be calculated. In this manner, the kinematic equations provide a useful means of predicting information about an object's motion if other information is known. For example, if the acceleration value and the initial and final velocity values of a skidding car is known, then the displacement of the car and the time can be predicted using the kinematic equations. Lesson 6 of this unit will focus upon the use of the kinematic equations to predict the numerical values of unknown quantities for an object's motion.

The four kinematic equations that describe an object's motion are:

There are a variety of symbols used in the above equations. Each symbol has its own specific meaning. The symbol  **d**  stands for the  **displacement**  of the object. The symbol  **t**  stands for the  **time**  for which the object moved. The symbol  **a**  stands for the  **acceleration**  of the object. And the symbol  **v**  stands for the velocity of the object; a subscript of i after the v (as in  **v**** i**) indicates that the velocity value is the **initial velocity** value and a subscript of f (as in **v ****f** ) indicates that the velocity value is the  **final velocity**  value.

### Solving the Problem with Kinematic Equation

Using the BIG 4 to Solve Problems

Each one of the kinematic equations contain 4 variables. If the value of 3 variables are known, then the 4th can be calculated.

#### **Problem-Solving Strategy**

In this part of Lesson 6 we will investigate the process of using the equations to determine unknown information about an object's motion. The process involves the use of a problem-solving strategy that will be used throughout the course. The strategy involves the following steps:

1. Construct an informative diagram of the physical situation.
2. Identify and list the given information in variable form.
3. Identify and list the unknown information in variable form.
4. Identify and list the equation that will be used to determine unknown information from known information.
5. Substitute known values into the equation and use appropriate algebraic steps to solve for the unknown information.
6. Check your answer to insure that it is reasonable and mathematically correct.

Example

Rex Things dropped his mother's vase out the window of his fourth story apartment 18.2 m above the ground. Determine the time it took for it to reach the ground.

Step 1: vO= 0 m/s d=-18.2m a=-9.8m/s^2

Step 2: t=????

Step 3: d= vi • t + 1/2 • a • t^2

Step 4: -18.2m = 1/2 •(-9.8m/s^2) • t^2

Step 5: 1.93s

### Kinematic Equation and Free Fall

That is to say that any object that is moving and being acted upon only be the force of gravity is said to be "in a state of  **free fall**." Such an object will experience a downward acceleration of 9.8 m/s/s. Whether the object is falling downward or rising upward towards its peak, if it is under the sole influence of gravity, then its acceleration value is 9.8 m/s/s.

Like any moving object, the motion of an object in free fall can be described by four kinematic equations. The kinematic equations that describe any object's motion are:

The symbols in the above equation have a specific meaning: the symbol  **d**  stands for the  **displacement** ; the symbol  **t**  stands for the  **time** ; the symbol  **a**  stands for the  **acceleration**  of the object; the symbol  **v**** i ** stands for the ** initial velocity ** value; and the symbol ** v ****f**  stands for the  **final velocity**.

#### **Applying Free Fall Concepts to Problem-Solving**

There are a few conceptual characteristics of free fall motion that will be of value when using the equations to analyze free fall motion. These concepts are described as follows:

- An object in free fall experiences an acceleration of -9.8 m/s/s. (The - sign indicates a downward acceleration.) Whether explicitly stated or not, the value of the acceleration in the kinematic equations is -9.8 m/s/s for any freely falling object.
- If an object is merely dropped (as opposed to being thrown) from an elevated height, then the initial velocity of the object is 0 m/s.
- If an object is projected upwards in a perfectly vertical direction, then it will slow down as it rises upward. The instant at which it reaches the peak of its trajectory, its velocity is 0 m/s. This value can be used as one of the motion parameters in the kinematic equations; for example, the final velocity ( **v**** f**) after traveling to the peak would be assigned a value of 0 m/s.
- If an object is projected upwards in a perfectly vertical direction, then the velocity at which it is projected is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the velocity that it has when it returns to the same height. That is, a ball projected vertically with an upward velocity of +30 m/s will have a downward velocity of -30 m/s when it returns to the same height.

### Kinematic Equations and Graphs

In that Lesson, it was emphasized that the slope of the line on a velocity-time graph is equal to the acceleration of the object and the area between the line and the time axis is equal to the displacement of the object. Thus, velocity-time graphs can be used to determine numerical values and relationships between the quantities displacement (d), velocity (v), acceleration (a) and time (t). In The focus has been upon the use of four kinematic equations to describe the motion of objects and to predict the numerical values of one of the four motion parameters - displacement (d), velocity (v), acceleration (a) and time (t). Thus, there are now two methods available to solve problems involving the numerical relationships between displacement, velocity, acceleration and time.

Example Problem - Graphical Solution

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture78.gif)

Consider an object that moves with a constant velocity of +5 m/s for a time period of 5 seconds and then accelerates to a final velocity of +15 m/s over the next 5 seconds. Such a verbal description of motion can be represented by a velocity-time graph. The graph is shown below.

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture79.gif)

The horizontal section of the graph depicts a constant velocity motion, consistent with the verbal description. The positively sloped (i.e., upward sloped) section of the graph depicts a positive acceleration, consistent with the verbal description of an object moving in the positive direction and speeding up from 5 m/s to 15 m/s. The slope of the line can be computed using the rise over run ratio. Between 5 and 10 seconds, the line rises from 5 m/s to 15 m/s and runs from 5 s to 10 s. This is a total rise of +10 m/s and a total run of 5 s. Thus, the slope (rise/run ratio) is (10 m/s)/(5 s) = 2 m/s2. Using the velocity-time graph, the acceleration of the object is determined to be 2 m/s2 during the last five seconds of the object's motion. The displacement of the object can also be determined using the velocity-time graph. The area between the line on the graph and the time-axis is representative of the displacement; this area assumes the shape of a trapezoid.The area of a trapezoid can be equated to the area of a triangle lying on top of the area of a rectangle. This is illustrated in the diagram below.

![](/images/topics/kinematics/Picture80.gif)



Rectangle

Area = base \* height

Area = (10 s) \* (5 m/s)

Area = 50 m



The total area is then the area of the rectangle plus the area of the triangle. The calculation of these areas is shown below.



Triangle

Area = 1/2 \* base \* height

Area = 1/2 \* (5 s) \* (10 m/s)

Area = 25 m



The total area (rectangle plus triangle) is equal to 75 m. Thus the displacement of the object is 75 meters during the 10 seconds of motion.
